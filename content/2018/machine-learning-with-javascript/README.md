title: 'Using JavaScript to Teach Machines How to Do Cool Shit'
category: 'machine learning'
---

What's the difference between machine learning and artificial intelligence? Can we use JavaScript to teach machines? How easy is it to teach these machines to do cool shit?

In this talk, I cover:

- The definition of machine learning and how the concept differs from artificial intelligence
  - "Machine learning paves the path to artificial intelligence"
- Supervised vs unsupervised learning
- Some basic machine learning types:
  - Liner Regression
  - Classification
  - Clustering
- Discrete vs continuous data, and what it tells us about the learning types
- A demo of how to improve a "dumb" Twitter bot using only a standard input (tweets)
- Bias-Variance Tradeoff
- The definition of a neural network and a couple of its types: artificial vs convolutional
- Why use JavaScript to implement these concepts?
  - What are the limitations to using JS (compared to using something more suited to handle large data sets)?
