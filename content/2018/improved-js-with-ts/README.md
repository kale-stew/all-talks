title: 'How TypeScript Made Me a Better JS Developer'
category: 'typescript'
---

In this talk, I cover the numerous ways working on a TypeScript in React.js application has improved my skills as a JavaScript developer overall.

We go over:

- How TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that provides optional static type checking
- Use cases for TypeScript (large scale, robust applications)
- Static vs Dynamically typed languages
- Comparing JavaScript syntax to TypeScript syntax by writing a simple button in both languages
- Benefits to working in a TypeScript codebase:
  - Write better component APIs and therefor codebase documentation using defined interfaces
  - Create more portable code as a result of documentation-first/TDD dev mindset
  - Increase dev speed by extending interfaces and leveraging VSCode's TypeScript support
- React.js's PropTypes and how they differ from TypeScript interfaces
- Common patterns for TS-in-React (like higher order components)
- Resources to get started learning and implementing TypeScript syntax
