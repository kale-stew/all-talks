title: 'TypeScript in React: A Love Story'
category: 'typescript, react'
---

This talk heavily leans on my experience using TypeScript in a production React application, and how much I benefitted as a developer using this combination of language and framework.

We cover:

- Statically typed vs dynamically typed languages
- Differences between TypeScript and JavaScript syntax in a simple React.js component
- TypeScript concepts: Interfaces, Unions, and Enums, `any`
- What I consider to be the pros of working in this type of codebase:
  - More portable code
  - Better documentation
  - Easy refactoring
  - Increased dev productivity
- How props differ from interfaces in composing better component APIs
- Libraries teams can use to improve the dev experience, like Storybook
