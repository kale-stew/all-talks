title: 'The Evolution of an API: A Case for GraphQL'
category: 'graphql'
---

In this talk, I follow API development over the years as well as the fundamentals of GraphQL, all the while making a case for its use in API development.

## Abstract

## Just Looking For Slides?

You could check out this [PDF of my slides](https://github.com/kale-stew/talks/blob/master/evolution-of-an-api/final.pdf).

Or maybe even the [live view](TODO).

Or even the [talk itself](TODO).

## Further Reading

- For a clear cut guide of what is actually happening under the hood of a Query, GraphQL's [documentation on execution](https://graphql.org/learn/execution/) is a great and thorough walkthrough.
