title: 'The Evolution of an API: A Case for GraphQL'
category: 'graphql'
---

In this talk, I follow API development over the years as well as the fundamentals of GraphQL, all the while making a case for its use in API development.

For a clear cut guide of what is actually happening under the hood of a Query, GraphQL's [documentation on execution](https://graphql.org/learn/execution/) is a great and thorough walk through.
