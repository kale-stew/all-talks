title: 'Demystifying `urql` using The Devtools!'
category: 'graphql'
---

In this talk, we go over a high-level overview of [`urql`](https://www.github.com/formidablelabs/urql)'s features and then dive into ways to explore those features using the [Chrome `urql-devtools` extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/urql-devtools/mcfphkbpmkbeofnkjehahlmidmceblmm?hl=en-US).

## Further Reading

- [How to URQL: A step-by-step guide](https://www.howtographql.com/react-urql/1-getting-started/)

  This tutorial was written by Formidable's own Phil Plukthun and Jovi de Crook, two of the lead urql and urql-devtools developers. It's a great introduction to `urql` as a client while also covering auth implementation with tools like `prisma`, all written in `react`.

- [The FormidaBlog](https://formidable.com/blog/) always has the latest info about large releases (like [this post](https://formidable.com/blog/2019/urql-explorer/) by Sofia Pohjalainen discussing the release of Explorer View), as they pertain to urql and the devtools. Worth keeping an eye on.

- The [`urql` docs](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs) are also a great place to get to know the basics of the library. An FAQ, API reference, and overview of basic concept are all available here.

- The [`urql` community on Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/urql?tab=posts) is another great place to talk to other urql users and the maintainers themselves.
