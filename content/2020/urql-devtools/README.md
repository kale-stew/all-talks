# Demystifying `urql` using The Devtools!

In this talk, we go over a high-level overview of [`urql`](https://www.github.com/formidablelabs/urql)'s features and then dive into ways to explore those features using the [Chrome `urql-devtools` extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/urql-devtools/mcfphkbpmkbeofnkjehahlmidmceblmm?hl=en-US).

  This tutorial was written by Formidable's own Phil Plukthun and Jovi de Crook, two of the lead urql and urql-devtools developers. It's a great introduction to `urql` as a client while also covering auth implementation with tools like `prisma`, all written in `react`.

- [The FormidaBlog](https://formidable.com/blog/) always has the latest info about large releases (like [this post](https://formidable.com/blog/2019/urql-explorer/) by Sofia Pohjalainen discussing the release of Explorer View), as they pertain to urql and the devtools. Worth keeping an eye on.
