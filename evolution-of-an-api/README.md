# The Evolution of an API: A Case for GraphQL

In this talk, I follow API development over the years as well as the fundamentals of GraphQL, essentially making a case for its use in API development.

From my talk at [UtahJS](https://conf.utahjs.com/) on September 20th, 2019.

## Abstract

## Just Looking For Slides?

You could check out this [PDF of my slides](https://github.com/kale-stew/talks/blob/master/evolution-of-an-api/final.pdf).

<!-- Or maybe even the [live view](https://github.com/kale-stew/talks/@TODO). -->

<!-- Or even the [talk itself](COMING SOON!). -->

## Further ADading

- For a clear cut guide of what is actually happening under the hood of a Query, GraphQL's [documentation on execution](https://graphql.org/learn/execution/) is a great and thorough walkthrough.

Thank you for having me, [UtahJS 2019](https://conf.utahjs.com/)!
