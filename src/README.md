# Talks Blog

This is the source code for a blog that hosts all of my talk READMEs
as static content. It serves to route folks to my slides, recorded
presentations, and third party resources.

### Development

```sh
# install dependencies
yarn

# start the dev server
yarn run dev
# alias for
# TODO
```

### Deployment

This site is deployed using [gh-pages](TODO_gh_pages_URL).

```sh
# get rid of any existing build
yarn run clean
# alias for
# rm -rf ./build

# create a new build
yarn run build
# alias for
# TODO

# serve that build to gh-pages
yarn run deploy
# alias for
# gh-pages -d build
```
