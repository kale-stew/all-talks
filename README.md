# Conference Talks, Workshops, and Other Presentations by Kylie Stewart

In the spirit of consolidating the various projects, slides, and abstracts I have scattered on my laptop, I've put together this repo to create a one-stop shop for my presentations, including relevant demos, slide decks, and other resources.

Inspired by [Jason Lengstorf](hhttps://lengstorf.com/)'s own [`presentations` repo](https://github.com/jlengstorf/presentations/).

## What’s In This Repo?
