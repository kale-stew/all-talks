# Conference Talks and Other Presentations

#### by Kylie Stewart

In the spirit of consolidating the many demo projects, slides, and abstracts I have scattered on my laptop, I've put together this repo to create a one-stop shop for my presentations, including relevant demos, slide decks, and other resources.

There is a hosted blog if you would like a better (see: prettier, more fluid, human-readable) navigation experience at [kylieis.online/talks](https://www.kylieis.online/talks).

_Inspired by [Jason Lengstorf](https://lengstorf.com/)'s own [`presentations` repo](https://github.com/jlengstorf/presentations/)._

## What’s In This Repo?

## Development

Every new entry is added to [`talks.json`](./content/talks.json) in the following format:

```json
{
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "event": [
    {
      "eventDate": "",
      "eventName": "",
      "eventType": "[conference || meetup]"
    }
  ],
  "exportedSlidesUrl": "",
  "hostedSlidesUrl": "",
  "previewImg": "",
  "recordedPresentationUrl": ""
}
```

And then, the year's README should be updated accordingly:

```md
<!-- Conferences -->

1. [Talk Title](./path_to_talk/README.md)

   Presented at **ConferenceName**<br/>📆 Month 00th<br/>📍 City, STATE

<!-- Meetups -->

1. [Talk Title](./path_to_talk/README.md)

   Presented at [MeetupName](https://www.meetup.com/MeetupName/events/randomhashfrommeetupdotcom)<br/>📆 Month 00th
```

## Deployment

CI handles that for us. 👨‍🚀 🚀
