# Conference Talks and Other Presentations

#### by Kylie Stewart

In the spirit of consolidating the many demo projects, slides, and abstracts I have scattered on my laptop, I've put together this repo to create a one-stop shop for my presentations, including relevant demos, slide decks, and other resources.

There is a hosted blog if you would like a better (see: prettier, more fluid, human-readable) navigation experience at [kylieis.online/talks](https://www.kylieis.online/talks).

_Inspired by [Jason Lengstorf](hhttps://lengstorf.com/)'s own [`presentations` repo](https://github.com/jlengstorf/presentations/)._

## What’s In This Repo?
