# Conference Talks and Other Presentations

#### by Kylie Stewart

Remaining to-do's:

- [] Deploy each set of slides as is
- [] Add more thorough detail to READMEs, all around
- [] .gitignore slide content for 2018, 2019 talks
- [] Start adding 2020 content

## Development

Every new entry is added to [`talks.json`](./talks/talks.json) in the following format:

```json
{
  "eventDate": "",
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "eventName": "",
  "eventType": "[conference || meetup]",
  "exportedSlidesUrl": "",
  "hostedSlidesUrl": "",
  "previewImg": ""
}
```
