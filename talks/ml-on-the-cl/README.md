# ML on the CL

These are the slides and demos from my talk on June 28th, 2018, at [js.la](https://js.la).

> Machine learning is everywhere, but how easy is it to get started? Could your small project benefit from some simple ML? In this talk, we will cover the very basics of artificial intelligence, as well as learn a Python-free approach to big data, basic algorithms, and how easy all of this is to implement in your average shopping cart with a single Node.js file.

In this talk, I cover the fundamentals of AI, introduce some basic definitions, and implement them using open sourced JavaScript libraries and `Node.js`.

## Projects

Although these projects also exist in the `demos/` dir at the root of this repository, you can follow their progress in their respective repositories:

1. `DEMO #1`: [personal-parody-bot](https://github.com/kale-stew/personal-parody-bot)
2. `DEMO #2`: [finish-my-thought-bot](https://github.com/kale-stew/finish-my-thought-bot)
3. `DEMO #3`: [smart-shopping-cart](https://github.com/kale-stew/smart-shopping-cart)
