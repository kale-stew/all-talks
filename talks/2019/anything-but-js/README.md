# Anything But JavaScript

These are the slides and demos from my talk at [Galvanize Platte](https://www.galvanize.com/campuses/denver-platte) about trying out languages beyond plain 'ol JavaScript.

In this talk, I cover the basics of getting started with TypeScript, ReasonML, and machine learning.
