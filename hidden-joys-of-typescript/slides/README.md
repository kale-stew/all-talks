# How TypeScript Made Me a Better JS Developer

These are the slides from my talk at the [FormidaDenver Open House](https://formidable-denver.eventbrite.com) on October 25th, 2018.

In this talk, I cover the various ways working on a TypeScript React application has improved my skills as a JavaScript developer overall.
